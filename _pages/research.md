# The stellar pheriphery of the Magellanic Clouds

## The Magellanic Stream / Magellanic Wake

# Globular clusters' tidal tails

# RR Lyrae stars as distance indicators

Through my research, I have studied the metallicity dependence of the near-IR period-luminosity relation of population II variable stars. In particular, as part of my Master's thesis project, I analysed the VISTA J and Ks light curves and variability of the population of variable stars of the most massive globular cluster of our Galaxy: omega Centauri. Having variable stars detected since photographic plate observations (Bailey et al. 1902), my thesis also involved a detailed analysis of the variable stars catalogue, finding new variables, discarding field stars and identifying some duplicate variables. 

In Navarrete et al. (2015, A&A, 577, 99), I studied the RR Lyrae sample of the cluster, showing the dependence of the Bailey diagram and period-luminosity diagram on the metallicity. I also provided calibrated period-luminosity relations for RRab and RRc stars in the J and Ks bands.

In Navarrete et al. (2017, A&A, 604, 120), the calibrated period-luminosity relations for RR Lyrae stars, Type II Cepheids and SX Phoenicis stars in the J and Ks bands were provided. These were the first near-IR calibration of the period-luminosity relation for SX Phoenicis stars.
